## About me <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/mona-loading-dark.gif" width="20" />
```
Hi! I am a Malaysia fresh graduate for diploma in computer science course (CS110) at UiTM.
Currently I have learnt C++, Java, Visual Basic, PHP, SQL, JS, Python, Prolog, and Android.
Right now I don't have any language that I am focused to, as I am still looking for a language that I might like.

Currently trying to explore more, and learn new stuff and do a side project once in a while.
Looking for notes and books on programming, so that I could learn more stuff.
