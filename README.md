```
Hi! I am a Malaysia student currently taking a diploma in computer science course (CS110) at UiTM.
Currently I have learnt C++, Java, Visual Basic, PHP, SQL, JS, Python, Prolog, and Android.
Right now I don't have any language that I am focused to, as I am still looking for a language that I might like.

Currently doing internship at a company for a duration of 6 months.
Looking at notes and books on programming, so that I could learn more stuff.
